# frizzle-lecture-viewer
A VR app for Oculus Quest for self learners to watch university lectures for self-learners. Watching lectures on YouTube is much harder than in a live class. There are too many distractions at home, and I found myself checking my phone when I lost focus.
It's also easy to procrastinate, when videos are avaiable on demand, it's easy to fall into the trap of "I'll do it later".

Frizzle solves both problems. It's an immersive VR environment, which prevents distractions. The lessons are also scheduled by an web server that the application talks to. So you can't procrastinate, since you'll "miss" the lecture.
